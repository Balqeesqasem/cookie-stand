### How Forms Work?

1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.
2. The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
3. The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store
the information in a database.
4. The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.
