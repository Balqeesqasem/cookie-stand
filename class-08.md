## CSS

I read about :

position:absolute
position:relative
position:fixed
float
### Screen Sizes :

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

- A Fixed Width Layout (Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.)
- A grid-Based Layout (Grids help create professional and flexible designs.)
- Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.


* CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.


* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
